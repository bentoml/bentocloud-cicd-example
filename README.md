# Build CI/CD pipelines for BentoCloud Deployments

This repository contains a simple example of building CI/CD workflows for iterating AI services on BentoCloud. You can choose to update your code or Deployment configurations, which will trigger a redeployment of your existing Deployment on BentoCloud.

For more information, see [the BentoML documentation](https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/scale-with-bentocloud/deployment/ci-cd-pipelines.html).
